The difficulty of this course starts to increase after the midterm exam, and it does get pretty tough nearing the end.

The lectures are often useless because instead of actually explaining how to solve problems, the whole lecture is wasted on proving random theorems that we will never be expected to prove. If you do bad on the midterm, don't give up as the content gets much better next term which means it is still possible for you to recover your mark. As far as I saw, the first part of the course is tough to wrap your head around for most people but the post midterm content is more computational and easier to understand.

Teaching proof techniques is the main focus of the course, and is done quite well -- but all the topics that we touched on (gcd, complex numbers, modular arithmetic), were interesting too! One assignment a week, which usually took 3-6 hours, plus three Mobius quizzes a week, open for 24 hours each. The midterm was challenging but still fair, and the final was much easier. My only regret is not taking MATH 145 instead. If you are anywhere near the Euclid score cutoff, you should apply for the advanced courses instead -- you will likely find 135 to be fairly easy.",liked course,1.0,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Neutral,Positive,Positive
